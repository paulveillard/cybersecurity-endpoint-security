##  `What is Endpoint Security? `

You'll often find the term **endpoint** used to describe systems, servers, and other types of devices that need protection. In computing, the term endpoint refers to pretty much anything connected to the network, and endpoint security refers to solutions designed to protect them.

[Endpoint security](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-endpoint-security), like endpoint detection and response, is the process of protecting devices like workstations, servers, and other devices (that can accept a security client) from malicious threats and cyberattacks. Endpoint security software enables businesses to protect devices that employees use for work purposes or servers that are either on a network or in the cloud from cyber threats.

- In this guide, when I talk about endpoints, I mean systems, laptops, servers, and even smartphones. If it talks to the network and can be compromised by an attacker, endpoint security should apply to it.


GRR, MIG, and osquery are endpoint-security solutions that allow investigators to inspect the systems of their infrastructure in real time.

##  `What is Endpoint Security? `

You'll often find the term **endpoint** used to describe systems, servers, and other types of devices that need protection. In computing, the term endpoint refers to pretty much anything connected to the network, and endpoint security refers to solutions designed to protect them.

[Endpoint security](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-endpoint-security), like endpoint detection and response, is the process of protecting devices like workstations, servers, and other devices (that can accept a security client) from malicious threats and cyberattacks. Endpoint security software enables businesses to protect devices that employees use for work purposes or servers that are either on a network or in the cloud from cyber threats.

- In this guide, when I talk about endpoints, I mean systems, laptops, servers, and even smartphones. If it talks to the network and can be compromised by an attacker, endpoint security should apply to it.
- 
An endpoint can be considered as a device that enables an employee to connect to a corporate network. The growth in BYOD and other connected systems such as the Internet of Things (IoT) is seeing the number of devices that could potentially connect to a network increase exponentially.

#### Some of the more common devices that can be considered an endpoint include:

- ATM machines
- IoT-enabled smart devices
- Industrial machines
- Laptop computers
- Medical devices
- Mobile phones
- Printers
- Servers
- Tablets
- Wearables, such as smartwatches

## `Endpoint Protection vs. Antivirus: What Is the Difference?`


> Antivirus software helps businesses detect, eliminate, and prevent malware from infecting devices. Antivirus solutions are installed directly on endpoint devices, such as laptops, PCs, network servers, and mobile devices. These solutions detect malware by scanning files and directories to discover patterns that match the definitions and signatures of a virus. They can also only recognize known threats and must be updated to detect the latest malware strains.


> Endpoint security threat prevention is fundamentally different from the approach of antivirus software. Instead of protecting an individual device, endpoint security solutions protect the entire business network, including all of the endpoints connecting to it.

There are several significant differences between endpoint protection and antivirus software. These include:

| Rank | Languages |  Languages |
|-----:|-----------|------------|
|     Device Coverage| Javascript|
|     Protection from threats| Javascript|
|     Continuous Protection| Python    |
|     3| SQL       |
